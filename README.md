### User Stories



## The Skeleton Plane
### Wireframes

#### Home Page
The main attraction on the home page is the image carusel in the middle looping through recipes in the database.
The images also contains the name of the recipe and a link to see the full recipe.

#### Recipe Page
The recipe page contains of cards for all the recipes in the database which are all clickable and takes the user to the recipe datails page.

#### Recipe Datails Page
The datails page gives the user a bigger picture of the recipe on the left hand side.
On the right hand side the user gets a full decription of the recipe.

## The Surface Plane
### Design
Like the wireframes show I decided to got with a very simple design for this project making the recipes the star of the show.
Sadly enough I ran out of time so the color and typography choices got overlooked.

### Images
The only images that exist on the page are images uploaded to the recipes since thats all this site is about.
Since I dident have time to take images of alot of food I decided to simply link to images that was already on the web.
In the long run it would probably be better to allow the user the choice to upload their own images or link to someone elses image.

## Features
### Navigation Bar
The top part of all pages consists of the navigation bar which shows different options if your logged in or not.
If your not logged in you get the options Home, Recipes, Log In and Register.
If your logged in the Log In and Register gets swapped out to Add a Recipe, Profile and Log out.
On smaller screens the nav bar changes to a hamburger meny with the same options.
